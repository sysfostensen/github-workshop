# General

Branching strategies help avoid developers stepping on each others toes. Branching strategies help developers ship code faster and avoid merge conflicts.


## Goals of a branching strategy
- Enhance productivity by ensuring proper coordination among developers
- Enable parallel development
- Help organise a series of planned and structured releases.
- Map a clear path when making changes to software through to production


## Which should we use

Trunk based is for super heros with strong automation or idiots,

**Feature branching** should be used by small self sufficient teams that can split their work in small chunks that can be finished within a very short period of time.

Open source projects should be doing forking strategies.

Release strategies for vendors supporting multiple versions of the same product.
