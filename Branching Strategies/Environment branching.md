Similar to [[GitFlow]], just more complex. Having both the release branching and in addition branches for each type of environment that this might get deployed to.
Grows in complexity depending on the number of environments and for each supported release. This is in addition to the hot fix.

We do not deploy source code directly to environments, we create releases that are then deployed to the environments.
