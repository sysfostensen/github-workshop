GitHub Flow and Feature Branching are two distinct Git workflows. Each uses branches for development of features, bug fixes, or other alterations. Nonetheless, they have notable differences regarding workflow, code review, and deployment.

1. Workflow:
   - GitHub Flow follows a streamlined, linear workflow. This includes creating a branch, adding commits, opening a pull request, discussing and reviewing modifications, merging the branch, and deploying.
   - Feature Branching follows a more general workflow where branches are created for each feature or modification. The work is done on the branch and once the feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch. This workflow can be tailored and integrated with other strategies (e.g., Gitflow) for more intricate projects.

2. Code review and collaboration:
   - Within GitHub Flow, code reviews and collaboration are fundamental to the process. Pull requests initiate discussions, solicit feedback, and maintain code quality before merging alterations into the main branch.
   - With Feature Branching, code reviews can be optional or follow varied processes, contingent on the team's preferences. Pull requests can be utilized, but they are not a compulsory part of the workflow.

3. Deployment and integration:
   - GitHub Flow underscores continuous integration and deployment. Changes are deployed to production or staging environments post-merging into the main branch.
   - For Feature Branching, deployment practices can differ based on the team's preferences and the specific workflow in use. Continuous integration is frequently advocated, but the emphasis may be more on merging finalized features rather than deploying changes immediately post-merging.

4. Flexibility:
   - GitHub Flow offers a straightforward, standardized workflow that is fitting for small to medium-sized teams and projects.
   - Feature Branching, being a broader concept, provides greater flexibility and can be adjusted to accommodate diverse team structures, project sizes, and complexity levels.

In conclusion, GitHub Flow is a specific execution of the Feature Branching concept, focusing on simplicity, code reviews via pull requests, and continuous integration and deployment. Conversely, Feature Branching is a broader workflow that can be tailored to suit various development processes and can be amalgamated with other branching strategies as necessary.
