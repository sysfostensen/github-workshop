One branch, main. All developers are working against this one branch and have cloned it to their computers.
This is the easiest strategy that is available, but it is also one of the hardest strategies to implement properly.

For this to work there needs to be strong automation for testing and deployment in place as well as the possibility of turning on/off features so that half baked solutions does not interfer with what is working.


1. Single Branch
2. High team maturity
3. Feature toggles
4. The true enabler for CD (Continues deployment)
